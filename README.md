Program Description
  These classes were created to practice inheritance. For example, all feline animals had their own properties while simultaneously having   properties from the Feline class. All animals would then battle each other in the critter arena with a myriad of factors such as mating,   eating, and fighting to determine which animal is the fittest to survive.
