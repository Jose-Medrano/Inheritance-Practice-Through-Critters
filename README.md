*Short-Response Questions*
1.) Describe access modifiers
  a.) public: Allows access from outside classes to interact with this
              associated variable. 
  b.) private: Does not allow any other classes to interact with the associated
               variables.
  c.) protected: Allows access from the associated variables to subclasses.
  d.) default: acts the same as public.

2.) One benefit of using inheritance is that the subclasses can inherit methods
    therefore there are some methods that dont need to be rewritten.

3.) A benefit of interfaces is that the variables and methods are abstract,
    therefore could be given any meaning or value to the subclasses.

4.) Interface references can only reference objects that implement the
    interface, therefore starfish can not be referenced by Movable.

5.) Because Starfish inherits the toString method from the Critter class.

6.) It would inherit getAttack() from its super, which is Feline. Therefore it
    would do the same attack as a Feline would. 

7.) Turtle has to Override getAttack() or else it would inherit the getAttack()
    from the Critter class.

8.) getMove() is from the Movable class. Starfish does not override getMove()
    because it does not implement getMove() therefore there is no method to
    override.

9.) Static variables are useful in cases where we want all the objects of a
    class to be aware of specific information at all time all the time.

10.) My critter is koala, and from what I seen they can get scaringly loud and
      have sharp claws therefore they Roar and Scratch. They live primarily in
      trees so the bounce from left to right (tree to tree) with the occasional
      up direction. They also eat a lot of eucalyptus there the Koala object
      must eat whenever it encounters food.
